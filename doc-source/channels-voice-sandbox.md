# Amazon Pinpoint voice sandbox<a name="channels-voice-sandbox"></a>

To help protect our customers from fraud and abuse, we place your account in a sandbox environment when you first create it\. The sandbox environment also helps you test the channel to help establish your reputation\. While your account is in the sandbox, you have full access to Amazon Pinpoint voice messaging, with the following restrictions: 
+ You have a daily limit of 20 messages\.
+ You can send a maximum of five voice messages to a single recipient during a 24\-hour period\.
+ You can send a maximum of five calls per minute\.
+ The maximum voice message length is 30 seconds\.
+ You can send voice messages only to specific countries\. For more information, see [Voice quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/quotas.html#quotas-voice) in the *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide*\.

When you're ready to move your account out of the voice sandbox, create an AWS Support case for a **Service limit increase** request\. For more information, see [Requesting production access](channels-voice-manage.md#channels-voice-manage-sandbox)\.

**Note**  
Before you request production access, you must send at least one voice message from your Amazon Pinpoint account\. You can send a voice message on the [Test Messaging](messages.md) page, or by using the [SendMessages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/apireference/apps-application-id-messages.html#SendMessages) API\.
