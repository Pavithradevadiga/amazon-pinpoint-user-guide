# Setting up the Amazon Pinpoint email channel<a name="channels-email-setup"></a>

To set up the Amazon Pinpoint email channel, you start by verifying the email address or domain that you want to use when you send email from that project\. Next, you create a project, enable the email channel in that project, and choose an email address or domain to use\.

When you enable the email channel for the first time, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't immediately provide production access for email messaging\. Instead, your AWS account has access only to the email sandbox, which imposes restrictions on your email traffic\. To gain production access, [submit a request](channels-email-setup-production-access.md) to AWS Support\.
